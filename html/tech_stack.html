        <h1>Technology Stack Recommendation for Collaborative Code Editor</h1>
        <h2>Frontend Technology:</h2>
        <p>For the frontend of a collaborative code editor, a reactive and real-time capable framework is crucial.
            Consider using:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>ReactJS or Vue.js:</strong> Both React and Vue.js provide the necessary components and libraries
                to build a responsive and interactive user interface. They also have good support for integrating
                real-time features.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Backend Technology:</h2>
        <p>The backend of a collaborative code editor needs to handle real-time communication, code synchronization, and
            user sessions. Consider using:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Node.js with Socket.IO:</strong> Node.js, with its event-driven, non-blocking architecture, is
                well-suited for handling real-time operations. Socket.IO is a popular library for enabling real-time
                bidirectional communication between the server and the clients through WebSockets.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Database Technology:</h2>
        <p>For a collaborative code editor, the choice of the database may differ from traditional applications as
            real-time collaboration often requires in-memory data handling. However, you may still need a database for
            user authentication and data persistence. Consider using:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>MongoDB or PostgreSQL:</strong> MongoDB, as a NoSQL database, can store user authentication data
                and non-relational user preferences. PostgreSQL, as a relational database, can handle more structured
                data and relational user information.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Collaboration and Version Control:</h2>
        <p>Collaborative code editors require effective version control to handle code changes from multiple users
            simultaneously. Consider using:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Git or Operational Transformations (OT):</strong> Git-based version control can be integrated
                into the collaborative code editor to manage code changes and resolve conflicts. Alternatively,
                Operational Transformations can be used to handle real-time concurrent edits to ensure consistency among
                users.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Real-Time Communication:</h2>
        <p>For real-time communication between users, you'll need technologies that enable instant messaging and
            real-time updates. Consider using:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>WebSockets or WebRTC:</strong> WebSockets provide a low-latency, bidirectional communication
                channel between the server and clients, allowing real-time updates. WebRTC is ideal for peer-to-peer
                communication and could be utilized for voice or video chat features.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Additional Considerations:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Containerization:</strong> Consider using containerization technologies like Docker to manage
                the deployment and scaling of the application effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Implement secure user authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth or JWT,
                to ensure that only authorized users can access the collaborative code editor.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Execution Sandbox:</strong> For testing and debugging purposes, you may need to create a
                secure code execution environment, such as a Docker container, to safely execute and test code snippets.
            </li>
        </ul>
