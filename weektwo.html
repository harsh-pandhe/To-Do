            <h2>Technology Selection and Setup</h2>
            <p>During the second week of the project, the focus will be on finalizing the technology stack for the
                frontend, backend, and database. The choice of technologies will impact the project's performance,
                scalability, and overall development process.</p>
            <p>Here are the steps for this week:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Frontend Technology:</strong> Select and justify the choice of frontend technology. Consider
                    factors such as React.js for building a dynamic user interface, its ecosystem of libraries, and its
                    popularity in the industry.</li>
                <li><strong>Backend Technology:</strong> Choose the backend technology, such as Node.js, considering its
                    event-driven architecture and suitability for real-time applications. Explore options like
                    Express.js
                    for building RESTful APIs.</li>
                <li><strong>Database Technology:</strong> Decide on the database technology. If NoSQL is preferred,
                    consider MongoDB for its flexibility in handling dynamic data structures. If SQL is chosen, explore
                    options like PostgreSQL.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Plan how the frontend, backend, and database will work together.
                    Define
                    the APIs for communication between frontend and backend, and determine how data will be stored and
                    retrieved from the database.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Finalizing the Technology Stack</h2>
            <p>After thorough research and consideration, the following technology stack has been chosen:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React.js</li>
                <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js with Express.js</li>
                <li><strong>Database:</strong> MongoDB</li>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> WebSockets using Socket.IO</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The chosen stack aligns with the project's goals of real-time collaboration and seamless user experience.
                React.js will provide a modular frontend structure, Node.js and Express.js will enable efficient
                backend development, and MongoDB will ensure flexible data storage.</p>
