# Collaborative Code Editor Dashboard

## Introduction

Welcome to the Collaborative Code Editor Dashboard! This dashboard serves as the central hub for managing and monitoring the development of the Collaborative Code Editor project over the course of 6 months. Here, you will find detailed information about the project's schedule, scope, requirements, and features.

## Project Scope

The Collaborative Code Editor web application aims to empower multiple programmers to collaborate in real-time on coding projects. The application provides a seamless coding environment supporting various programming languages, enabling users to create accounts, edit code together, chat, perform version control, and execute code within the platform.

## Requirements and Features

### Requirements

1. **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can register with the platform using email and password. Authentication is required to securely access the collaborative coding environment.

2. **Code Editor with Syntax Highlighting:** Implement a code editor with syntax highlighting for various programming languages to improve readability and coding experience.

3. **Real-Time Collaboration:** Integrate real-time collaboration features using technologies like WebSockets to synchronize code changes across multiple users in real-time.

4. **Cursor Tracking and User Presence:** Display the positions of each user's cursor in the code editor. Show users' presence status (online/offline) to enhance collaboration.

5. **Chat and Communication:** Provide a chat feature for users to communicate while working on the same code.

6. **Version Control and History:** Implement version control to track code changes and allow users to revert to previous versions if needed.

7. **Language Selection and Code Execution:** Allow users to choose their preferred programming language from a list of supported languages. Integrate a code execution feature to enable users to test code directly within the platform.

8. **Error Highlighting and Debugging:** Add features to highlight syntax errors and assist with debugging code in real-time.

9. **File Sharing and Project Management:** Enable users to share files and collaborate on entire coding projects.

10. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the platform is responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Features

1. **User Registration and Login:** Allow users to create accounts and log in to the platform securely using email and password.

2. **Real-Time Code Collaboration:** Enable multiple users to collaborate on code in real-time, with synchronized updates and live cursor tracking.

3. **Syntax Highlighting for Various Languages:** Enhance code readability by implementing syntax highlighting for a wide range of programming languages.

4. **File Management:** Allow users to create, upload, and organize files within projects for easy collaboration and version control.

5. **Real-Time Chat:** Provide a real-time chat feature that allows users to communicate with each other while working on the same code.

6. **Version History:** Keep track of code changes and revisions, enabling users to view and revert to previous versions of their code.

7. **Error Highlighting:** Highlight syntax errors and provide real-time suggestions to assist users in debugging their code.

8. **Code Execution:** Allow users to run their code within the platform to test its functionality and correctness.

9. **File Sharing:** Enable users to share their coding projects with collaborators or the wider community, promoting collaboration and knowledge exchange.

10. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is responsive and user-friendly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Team Roles and Responsibilities

- **Project Manager:** Responsible for overall project planning, coordination, and communication with team members. Ensures that project goals and milestones are met.

- **Front-end Developer:** In charge of designing and implementing the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Works on integrating the real-time collaboration features.

- **Back-end Developer:** Responsible for developing the server-side logic using a suitable programming language and handling user authentication, code execution, and chat functionality.

- **Quality Assurance (QA) Tester:** Focuses on testing the application, identifying and reporting bugs, and ensuring the application meets the specified requirements and quality standards.

## Project Schedule

The project schedule is divided into six months, with each month representing specific development phases. Here's a breakdown of the schedule:

- **Month 1:** Project Planning and Setup
- **Month 2:** Core Features Implementation
- **Month 3:** Code Versioning and Error Handling
- **Month 4:** Collaborative Project Management
- **Month 5:** User Testing and Documentation
- **Month 6:** Final Refinement and Deployment

Please refer to the detailed schedule above for a week-by-week plan for each development phase.

## Note

The provided time-schedule is a general guideline and can be adjusted based on the complexity of individual features, the team's expertise, and any unexpected challenges encountered during development. Regularly review the progress and adapt the schedule as necessary to ensure a successful and on-time completion of the Collaborative Code Editor project.
